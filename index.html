        There are various brands of Dogs in the world. That ranges from small, medium to the large dogs.
        My favourate dog is "German Shepherd". I pet two German Shepherd and were so audorable and friendly.
        One day, i lost both of them and it was my tragedy day.

        Frm then onward i never was interested to pet any dogs. Now my kids are growing and wanted to have a pets.
        I have to rethink of getting the dog back to my home.
